# Estimating temporally variable selection intensity from ancient DNA data with a combination of forward- and backward-in-time simulations
Source code is implemented for an MCMC-based method for inferring temporally variable selection from ancient DNA data (in format of genotype likelihoods), and the preprint has been submitted to Molecular Biology and Evolution, available at
