# Estimating temporally variable selection intensity from ancient DNA data II
The source code is implemented for an MCMC-based method for inferring temporally variable selection from ancient DNA data (in the format of genotype likelihoods), and the manuscript has been submitted to Molecular Biology and Evolution, available at https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msad008. Except for the PMMH-within-Gibbs procedure described in the manuscript, we also provide an adaptive version that improves the convergence of the chain.
